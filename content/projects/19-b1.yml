  <p><b>BENDER-I (or B1 for short) is a fictional computer system I've created for fun and profit (well, maybe only for fun).</b> The name is, of course, a tribute to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)">Bender Bending Rodr√≠guez</a>, a fictional character in the animated series Futurama, who happens to be powered by the same CPU as B1 computer.</p>
  <p>B1 computer system consists of the venerable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">MOS Technology 6502</a> microprocessor, 64kB of RAM, a video processing unit providing a text-mode 40 by 25 character display and a simple 8-bit mono sound generator.</p>
  <p>Currently there are no hardware implementations of the B1 computer. The reference, and only, implementation is the B1 Emulator.</p>
