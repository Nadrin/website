  <p><b>Ambience is a RPG music player/manager created to help Game Masters to quickly manage background music in a way that is non-disruptive to the overall atmosphere and players' sense of immersion.</b> It is operated entirely through user-defined keyboard shortcuts. Computer keyboard can be well hidden somewhere near the GM and if particular key combinations are memorized Ambience can be successfully operated with turned off display.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that it's mostly a quick hack, written almost entirely in one evening for the sole purpose of aiding the author in his own RPG session. ;-) It features seamless music playblack with crossfade effect, console text interface with global hotkeys and is configured via simple XML music set definition file.</p>
