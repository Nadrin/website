  <p><b>This project aims to provide a convenient replacement for standard login program found on many POSIX compliant systems.</b> It provides a basic login shell, similar to one found in GNU HURD, that apart from performing a login action, can also reboot or shutdown the system. It uses PAM for authorization and session management.</p>
  <p>When desired using the <q>xlshd</q> daemon it can also sucesfully replace a display manager such as GDM.</p>
